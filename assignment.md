Edward Snowden can be seen on two sides of an ethical dillemma. The first is as a traitor to the U.S. Government. Snowden released many documents and some would way that not all were required to expose the level to which government oversight extends. These documents could have led to national security breaches that put American lives in danger. The other view of Snowden's actions can be of a whistleblower who exposed how far the American government was going to intrude on the privacy of its citizens. It can be seen as unethical to carry out this oversight and exposing it to be important to keeping the public informed.
